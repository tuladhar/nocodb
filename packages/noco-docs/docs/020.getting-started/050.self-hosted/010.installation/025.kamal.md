# Kamal

Kamal provides several advantages over other deployment methods:

- Zero-downtime deploys.
- Rolling restarts.
- A simple one-command setup, deploy and upgrade process.
- Automatic HTTPS via Lets Encrypt with auto-renewal.


## Prerequisites

To follow along with the tutorial, ensure you have the following:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [DockerHub Account](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org)
- A domain name: For accessing NocoDB web UI and obtaining a free LetsEncrypt SSL certificate for secure HTTPS access.
- A VPS (Virtual Private Server): For self-hosting NocoDB on a public cloud server.


## Step 1. Ensure you have SSH access to the server via public key.

Add this to your ~/.ssh/config.
```
Host my-nocodb
  HostName 1.2.3.4
  IdentityFile /location/to/your/private-key
  User root
```

Then verify thta you can access it:
```
ssh root@my-nocodb
```

## Step 2. Create an access¬†token in DockerHub

During deployment, Kamal need to pulls the container images from DockerHub registry, and ofr that it needs credentials. It is recommended to use an access token instead of a password for better security.

If you do not have a DockerHub account, you can create one here. Once you have an account, [follow these steps to create an access token](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/#create-an-access-token)

- Access permission: Public Repo Read-Only

Save the access token somewhere safe.

## Step 2. Setup Kamal

Create a directory and run:
```
mkdir self-hosted-nocodb
kamal init
```

Edit the `config/deploy.yml` file, and copy/paste the following:
```
service: nocodb
image: nocodb/nocodb
servers:
  web:
  - 192.168.0.1           # Substitute 192.168.0.1 with the actual public IP of your newly created server.
proxy: 
  ssl: true
  host: app.example.com   # Sustite with your domain
  app_port: 8080
  healthcheck:
    path: /
    interval: 10
    timeout: 5 
env:
  secret:
    - NC_REDIS_URL
    - NC_DB    
registry:
  username: my-user # Subsittue
volumes:
- "/nocodb/:/usr/app/data/"
accessories:
  db:
    image: postgres:16.1
    host: certsdiscount-app1
    port: 3306
    env:
      secret:
        - POSTGRES_DB
        - POSTGRES_USER
        - POSTGRES_PASSWORD
    volumes:
      - ./postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  redis:
    image: redis:7.4
    host: certsdiscount-app1
    port: 6379
    volumes:
    - ./redis:/data
```


## Step 3. Deploy

```
export KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=...
kamal setup -P --version 0.257.0
```

# Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check the logs using the following command:

```
docker-compose logs
```

If you need to stop the services, use the following command:

docker-compose down

Ensure all required ports are available on your host machine.

For database connection issues, verify the database service is running:

docker-compose ps


## Step 3. Setup Kamal


## Step 2. Run

```
kamal setup -P --version 0.257.0
```

## Quick installation guide

This is quick walkthrough of how to install NocoDB using Kamal.

- **Step 1** :  üîê SSH into your server (Linux-based system - Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS etc.)
- **Step 2** :  üöÄ Run the below command:
       ```bash
       bash <(curl -sSL http://install.nocodb.com/noco.sh) <(mktemp)
       ```
- **Step 3** :  üåê Open your browser and go to URL
   - For üåç HTTP: `http://<your-domain-or-ip>`
   - For üîí HTTPS: `https://<your-domain-or-ip>`
- **Step 4** :  üê¶ Don't keep the command a secret. Tweet how easy it is. This step is a must!

:::info
You can find the install.nocodb.com/noco.sh script [on our GitHub here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nocodb/nocodb/develop/docker-compose/1_Auto_Upstall/noco.sh)
:::

## Detailed installation guide

1. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    bash <(curl -sSL http://install.nocodb.com/noco.sh) <(mktemp)
    ```

3. Follow the installation prompts
    - **Domain name**: Enter the IP address or domain name for your NocoDB instance.
    - **SSL configuration**: If you entered a valid domain name, you'll be asked if you want to configure SSL.
    - **Advanced options**: You can choose to show advanced options or use default settings.

4. Advanced options (if chosen):
    - Choose between community (CE) or enterprise edition (EE)
    - Enter license key (for EE)
    - Enable/disable Redis for caching
    - Enable/disable Minio for file storage
    - Configure Minio domain and SSL
    - Enable/disable Watchtower for automatic updates
    - Set the number of NocoDB instances to run

5. Wait for installation to complete  - takes about 2-5 minutes.
   Once done, you'll see a success message with the URL to access your NocoDB instance.

6. Access NocoDB  
   Open the URL provided in your browser to access NocoDB.

7. Congratulations! You should now have a working installation of NocoDB. Enjoy using your new no-code database platform!


## Installation management menu

After installation, you'll be asked if you want to start the management menu. This menu allows you to:

- Start NocoDB
- Stop NocoDB
- View logs
- Restart NocoDB
- Upgrade NocoDB
- Scale NocoDB (change the number of running instances)
- Monitor NocoDB (view Docker stats)

## Additional Notes

- The script creates an update.sh file in the installation directory. You can use this to update NocoDB in the future.
- If you encounter any issues during installation, check the logs for error messages.
